	This product will be made for the IEEE 2022 robotics competition in Houston Texas on April 2nd. The competition rules explains the full scope of the project but a short summary will be provided here. The objective of the competition is to make a underwater remote controlled submarine that is capable of collecting trash in hard to reach places. As such, the competition includes a number of obstacles that need to be navigated. The submarine will be remote controlled through a series of obstacles that involve hoops both forwards and backwards. Then the robot continues on to the second round. The objective will be to grasp debris that is meant to be mimicking trash in an ocean or river and navigate to a suppository station. The debris will be deposited and then more debris will be collected floating atop the water. That trash will then be deposited in a secondary trash station. In both rounds judges will be watching and award points based on speed, performance, and cost specifications of the robot. The faster and cheaper that the robot can operate the more points will be awarded.
